TODO: Clean up code. Figure out how to use a proper database.

V 2.1:
Gcloud can't write files to project directory, so tried switching to GCloud MySQL database. Didn't work properly (actually hard), so switched to google sheets as a database instead. Now it read/writes messages correctly. 

V 2.0: 
Added SQlite database and a reset log page. Now shouldn't be resetting messages every few hours/days.

V 1.0: 
Added main functionalities of the web app, including writing and reading messages.
